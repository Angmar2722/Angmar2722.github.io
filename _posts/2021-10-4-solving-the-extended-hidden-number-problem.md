![TSG 2021 Writeup](/assets/img/ctfImages/2021/tsg2021/logo.png)

I participated in the University of Tokyo's <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/1431" target="_blank">TSG 2021 CTF</a> event (Sat, 02 Oct. 2021, 15:00 SGT â€” Sun, 03 Oct. 2021, 15:00 SGT) during the weekend. Even though I am currently still in high school, I was invited to join the National University of Singapore's CTF team, <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/16740" target="_blank">NUSGreyhats</a>, by Diamondroxxx and we ranked 31<sup>st</sup> out of 775 scoring teams.

The reason why I am writing this as a blog post instead of a usual CTF writeup is because I could only solve the beginner's crypto challenge and most of my time was spent solving the ECDSA biased nonce challenge 'Flag Is Win'. However, due to an **incredibly** stupid mistake, me and Diamondroxxx only solved the challenge about 30 minutes after the CTF ended which **really, really sucks**. 

The point of this blog post is to explain both to myself and othes, how to crack the nonce of an ECDSA signature scheme if it does not have uniform random distribution and has low entropy by solving the Extended Hidden Number Problem (EHNP) using lattice reduction techniques.

Below is the writeup for the challenge Flag is Win :

## Flag is Win

![TSG 2021 Writeup](/assets/img/ctfImages/2021/tsg2021/img1.png)

The server source code provided (written in Ruby) :

```ruby

require 'openssl'
require 'digest'

STDOUT.sync = true

class OpenSSL::PKey::EC::Point
  def xy
    n = to_bn(:uncompressed).to_i
    mask = (1 << group.degree) - 1
    return (n >> group.degree) & mask, n & mask
  end
  alias_method :+, :add
  alias_method :*, :mul
end

class ECDSA
  def initialize
    @curve = OpenSSL::PKey::EC::Group.new('secp256k1')
    @G = @curve.generator
    @n = @curve.order.to_i
    @d = OpenSSL::BN.rand(@curve.degree).to_i
    @Q = @G * @d
  end

  def inv(x)
    x.pow(@n - 2, @n)
  end

  def sign(msg)
    z = Digest::SHA256.hexdigest(msg).hex
    k = OpenSSL::BN.rand(@curve.degree / 3).to_s.unpack1('H*').hex
    x, y = (@G * k).xy

    # We should discourage every evil hacks
    s = (z + x * @d) * inv(k) % @n

    return x, s
  end

  def verify(msg, x, s)
    return false if x % @n == 0 || s % @n == 0
    z = Digest::SHA256.hexdigest(msg).hex

    # ditto
    x2, y2 = (@G * (z * inv(s)) + @Q * (x * inv(s))).xy

    return x == x2
  end
end

ecdsa = ECDSA.new

5.times do
  puts <<~EOS
    1. Sign
    2. Find rule
    3. Exit
  EOS

  print 'choice? '

  case gets.chomp
  when '1'
    x, s = ecdsa.sign('Baba')
    puts 'Baba is:'
    puts "x = #{x}"
    puts "s = #{s}"
  when '2'
    print 'Which rule do you want to know? '; msg = gets.chomp
    print 'x? '; x = gets.to_i
    print 's? '; s = gets.to_i

    if ecdsa.verify(msg, x, s)
      if msg == 'Baba'
        puts 'Baba is you'
      elsif msg == 'Flag'
        puts "Flag is #{ENV['FLAG']}"
      else
        puts 'Not Found :('
      end
    else
      puts 'Invalid :('
    end
  else
    exit
  end
end

puts 'You is defeat.'

```

Looking at the source code, our task is pretty straightforward as our objective is to sign the SHA-256 hash of the word 'Flag'. When connecting to the server, we are given 5 tries. In each try, we can either sign the word 'Baba' using ECDSA, provide a signature for a given message or exit the session. A standard curve `secp256k1` is used. Obviously we would have to see what is going on with the signing mechanism used here.

<br/>

### ECDSA Recap

Remember that in elliptic curve cryptography, first a random number `d` is used as the private key by multiplying the generator or base point `d` times to reach some final public point `Q`.

Here is how to sign a message *m* using the private key IN ECDSA :

1. Hash the message: \\( h = SHA256(m) \\)
2. Sample a random nonce: \\( k = n \qquad \qquad (n \in \mathbb{Z}^+) \\)
3. Exponentiate by the nonce: \\( r = x_1 \mod n \\)
4. Reduce the x-coordinate mod the group order: \\( r = x_1 \mod n \\)
5. Complete the signature: \\( s = k^{-1} (h + r d) \mod n \\)
6. Signature is: \\( \sigma = (r, s) \\)

<br/>

### Biased Nonces

Looking at the `sign` function, we can see that the secret nonce `k` is generated really weirdly. To quote rkm0959's writeup for the <a href="https://rkm0959.tistory.com/232?category=765103" target="_blank">H1 challenge</a> in Google CTF 2021, "The ECDSA nonce is yelling loudly at us to attack it which we obviously have to do." Lmao

Usually the `k` should be a uniformally distributed random number however there is very low entropy over here. Note that while `OpenSSL::BN.rand(@curve.degree / 3)` does generate a large random 85 bit number, by appending `.to_s.unpack1('H*')`, a 3 is inserted to the left of every digit of this random number. The image below demonstrates this (the first value is the random number while the second is the number with the `.to_s.unpack1('H*')` added) :

![TSG 2021 Writeup](/assets/img/ctfImages/2021/tsg2021/img2.png)

After that this number is converted to hexadecimal. Wow! So effectively only half of the bits of the nonce have entropy. That is very bad to say the least......

<br/>

### Deriving a Mathematical Expression For \\( k \\)

Firstly, we would have to come up with a precise mathematical expression for the nonce. Suppose that we consider the digits of `k` where \\((0 \leq n \leq 9 )\\).    

$$ k = \quad 3 \ n_{25} \quad 3 \ n_{24} \quad 3 \ n_{23} \quad .... \quad 3 \ n_2 \quad 3 \ n_1 \quad 3 \ n_0 $$

We can rewrite this as a mix of binary and the unknown digits \\( n \\) where: 

$$ k = \quad 0011 \ n_{25} \quad 0011 \ x_{24} \quad 0011 \ x_{23} \quad .... \quad 0011 \ x_2 \quad 0011 \ x_1 \quad 3 \ x_0 $$

Now we can consider each byte of \\( \quad 0011 \ n_{i} \quad \\) where \\(i \\) represents some \\(i^{th}\\) bit from the LSB side:

$$ B_i \quad = \quad 0011 \ n_i \quad = \quad 3 << 4 + n_i \quad = \quad 48 + n_i $$

Now rewriting \\(k\\) we have:

$$ k \ = \ B_{25} \quad B_{24} \quad B_{23} \quad .... \quad B_{2} \quad B_1 \quad B_0  $$

$$ k \ = \ B_0 \quad + \quad B_1 << 2^{8*1} \quad + \quad B_2 << 2^{8*2} \quad + \quad .... \quad + \quad B_{24} << 2^{25*7} \quad + \quad B_{24} << 2^{25*8} $$

$$ \therefore k = \sum_{i=0}^{25} \ B_i \ \cdot 2^{8i} $$

$$ k = \sum_{i=0}^{25} \ (48 + n_i) \ \cdot 2^{8i} $$

$$ \therefore k = \sum_{i=0}^{25} \ 48 \ \cdot 2^{8i} \ + \ \sum_{i=0}^{25} \ n_i \ \cdot 2^{8i} $$

Great, now we have an expression for the nonce `k` where a constant term and the unknown digit \\( n_i \\) are separated. 

<br/>

### Cancelling Out the Private Key \\( d \\)

Now, consider the message, signature pair \\( (r_1, s_1, h_1) \\) and \\( (r_2, s_2, h_1) \\) where \\( h_1 \\) represents the SHA-256 hash of the word 'Baba'. We know from the definition of ECDSA that:

$$ s_1 = k_1^{-1} \ \cdot (h_1 + r_1 \ \cdot d) $$

$$ s_2 = k_2^{-1} \ \cdot (h_2 + r_2 \ \cdot d) $$

Here we already obtained a mathematical expression for \\( k \\) hence:

$$ \left( \sum_{i=0}^{25} \ 48 \ \cdot 2^{8i} \ + \ \sum_{i=0}^{25} \ n_i \ \cdot 2^{8i} \right) \cdot s_1 \equiv h_1 + r_1 d \pmod{n}$$

$$ \left( \sum_{i=0}^{25} \ 48 \ \cdot 2^{8i} \ + \ \sum_{i=0}^{25} \ n_i \ \cdot 2^{8i} \right) \cdot s_2 \equiv h_1 + r_2 d \pmod{n}$$

Here \\( n \\) represents the prime used in this elliptic curve. Then, we can remove \\( d \\) from this set of equations. Since:

\\(\quad \frac{k1 \ \cdot s_1 \ \ - \ h_1}{r_1} \quad \equiv d \pmod{n} \quad\\) and \\( \quad \frac{k2 \ \cdot s_2 \ \ - \ h_1}{r_2} \quad \equiv d \pmod{n} \\)

$$ \therefore \quad \quad \frac{k1 \ \cdot s_1 \ \ - \ h_1}{r_1} \quad \equiv \quad \frac{k2 \ \cdot s_2 \ \ - \ h_1}{r_2} \pmod{n} $$

$$ r_2 \ ( k_1 \ \cdot s_1 \ - \ h_1) \ \quad \equiv \quad r_1 \ ( k_2 \ \cdot s_2 \ - \ h_1) \pmod{n} $$

$$ r_2 \ \cdot k_1 \ \cdot s_1 \ - \ h_1 \ \cdot r_2 \quad \equiv \quad r_1 \ \cdot k_2 \ \cdot s_2 \ - \ h_1 \ \cdot r_1 \pmod{n} $$

$$ (r_2 \ \cdot k_1 \ \cdot s_1) \ \ - \ (r_1 \ \cdot k_2 \ \cdot s_2) \quad \equiv \quad h_1 \ \cdot r_2 \ - \ h_1 \ \cdot r_1 \pmod{n} $$

This means that for some \\( a \\) where \\( (a \in \mathbb{Z}^+) \\) :

$$ \quad \therefore (r_2 \ \cdot k_1 \ \cdot s_1) \ \ - \ (r_1 \ \cdot k_2 \ \cdot s_2) \quad + \quad a \ \cdot n \quad = \quad \quad h_1 \ \cdot r_2 \ - \ h_1 \ \cdot r_1 $$ 

Now substituting the mathematical expression that we derived for `k` in this challenge:

$$ \quad \therefore (r_2 \ \cdot \left( \sum_{i=0}^{25} \ 48 \ \cdot 2^{8i} \ + \ \sum_{i=0}^{25} \ n_i \ \cdot 2^{8i} \right) \ \cdot s_1) \ \ - \ (r_1 \ \cdot \left( \sum_{i=0}^{25} \ 48 \ \cdot 2^{8i} \ + \ \sum_{i=0}^{25} \ n_i \ \cdot 2^{8i} \right) \ \cdot s_2) \quad + \quad a \ \cdot n \quad = \quad h_1 \ \cdot r_2 \ - \ h_1 \ \cdot r_1 $$ 

<br/>

### Matrices, Lattices, rkm0959's CVP Inequality Solver and the Extended Hidden Number Problem

This is the part where the level of mathematics was far beyond us. We managed to solve the challenge by carefully looking at and observing how people solved the <a href="https://github.com/google/google-ctf/blob/master/2021/quals/crypto-H1/src/chall.py" target="_blank">H1 challenge</a> in Google CTF 2021. After obtaining the mathematical expression shown above, we used <a href="https://github.com/rkm0959/Inequality_Solving_with_CVP" target="_blank">rkm0959's Inequality Solver with CVP</a>. We observed his writeup for the <a href="https://rkm0959.tistory.com/232?category=765103" target="_blank">H1 challenge</a> and created a similar matrix to the one he used for that challenge, only this time we would be using the mathematical expressions derived above. 

Hence we constructed a 53 by 53 matrix such that :

$$\begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \text{...} & 0 & 0 & 0 & r2 \ \cdot s1 \ \cdot 2^{8 \ \cdot 0} \pmod{n} \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & \text{...} & 0 & 0 & 0 & r2 \ \cdot s1 \ \cdot 2^{8 \ \cdot 1} \pmod{n} \\ 
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & \text{...} & 0 & 0 & 0 & r2 \ \cdot s1 \ \cdot 2^{8 \ \cdot 2} \pmod{n} \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & \text{...} & 0 & 0 & 0 & r2 \ \cdot s1 \ \cdot 2^{8 \ \cdot 3} \pmod{n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \text{...} & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \text{...} & 1 & 0 & 0 & r1 \ \cdot s2 \ \cdot 2^{8 \ \cdot 49} \pmod{n} \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \text{...} & 0 & 1 & 0 & r1 \ \cdot s2 \ \cdot 2^{8 \ \cdot 50} \pmod{n} \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \text{...} & 0 & 0 & 1 & r1 \ \cdot s2 \ \cdot 2^{8 \ \cdot 51} \pmod{n} \\ 
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \text{...} & 0 & 0 & 0 & n \\ 
\end{bmatrix}$$

After creating this matrix, we made sure that the lower bound and upper bounds for the CVP solver were 48 and 57 respectively as each 'byte' (as defined above where a byte consists of the 3 as well as the unknown digit nibble from 0 to 9) would range from 48 + 0 all the way to 48 + 9. After taking some time to set up the matrix and fine tune it, we could then chuck it into the CVP solver and hopefully obtain all 'bytes' for each of the 2 nonces we are solving for. I hope to understand how the solver works in the future, all I am aware of is that it uses advanced lattice based reduction techniques like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenstra%E2%80%93Lenstra%E2%80%93Lov%C3%A1sz_lattice_basis_reduction_algorithm" target="_blank">Lenstraâ€“Lenstraâ€“LovÃ¡sz lattice basis reduction algorithm </a>, popularly known as LLL and solves the <a href="https://crypto.hyperlink.cz/files/SAC06-rosa-hlavac.pdf" target="_blank">Extended Hidden Number Problem</a> in order to recover the nonce.

Nearly always, the solver gave us the nonce 'bytes' (the 3 and unknown digit) from the LSB to the MSB. The incredibly egregious mistake that we made was that for some reason which we will never know, we were reading from the MSB to the LSB and never even detected this error. We knew something was going wrong obviously and we thought that somehow, somewhere the matrix that we setup was incorrect. Maybe because we were staying up late at around 4 am, we were just exhausted? Anyways, Diamondroxxx messages me 7 minutes after the CTF ended that he realized that we were reading from the MSB to the LSB. After that we really wanted to know if what we did was correct and indeed it was after fixing the error. Hence we could recover the nonce `k` and hence easily recover the private key `d`, after which signing any message was trivial.

After looking at the writeups, it turns out that most people were using another lattice reduction algorithm known as BKZ (Block Korkine Zolotarev) including <a href="https://rkm0959.tistory.com/241?category=765103" target="_blank"> rkm himself</a> (he was also using his CVP Inequality solver). We also tried out the BKZ algorithm  and althought it worked, for us, LLL was much faster.

### Closing Thoughts

- Although I don't understand enough about lattice reduction techniques, I am still glad that we were able to solve this challenge. This is something I want to spend time on and understand in the immediate future.
- The writeups for the H1 challenge in Google CTF 2021 is a gift that keeps on giving.
- rkm's solver is one of humanity's greatest treasures
- Technically, we only solved this challenge slightly after the CTF ended. Since we also failed to solve H1, hopefully we can solve the third biased nonce ECDSA challenge as I dont want it to be another loss or LLL, pun intended ;D
