<a href="https://cryptohack.org/" target="_blank">CryptoHack</a> seems to be a really well made website which allows you to learn Cryptography and seems well suited for beginners like me. I have absolutely no clue about how cryptography works so hopefully this website helps me practice and build up my skills for future crypto challenges in CTFs :D
