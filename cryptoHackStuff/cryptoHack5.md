The Mathematics section consists of 22 challenges. The challenges are subdivided into 6 different stages : Modular Math, Lattices, Probability, Brainteasers Part 1, Brainteasers Part 2 and Primes. Below are the writeups for the ones I managed to complete for the Probability, Brainteasers Part 1, Brainteasers Part 2 and Primes sections :
