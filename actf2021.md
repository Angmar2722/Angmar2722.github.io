title: Angstrom 2021 CTF Writeup
---
<hr/>

Me and my team competed in the Montgomery Blair High School's Angstrom CTF event (Saturday, 3rd April, 0:00 UTC - Wednesday, 7th April, 23:59 UTC). This was my longest CTF yet (5 days, 120 hours). We ranked 278th out of 1502 teams (1245 scoring).

I managed to solve 6 challenges (and fill out one survey :D), most of which involved binary exploitation.

Below are the writeups for the challenges that I managed to solve :
