title: Angstrom 2021 CTF Writeup
---
<hr/>

Me and my team competed in the Montgomery Blair High School's Angstrom CTF event (Saturday, 3rd April, 0:00 UTC - Wednesday, 7th April, 23:59 UTC). This was my longest CTF yet (5 days, 120 hours). We ranked 278th out of 1502 teams (1245 scoring).

I managed to solve 6 challenges (and fill out one survey :D), most of which involved binary exploitation.

Below are the writeups for the challenges that I managed to solve :

# Float On (Miscellaneous Challenge)

![ACTF 2021 Writeup](/assets/img/ctfImages/actf2021/img1.png)

Source code :

``` c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <assert.h>

#define DO_STAGE(num, cond) do {\
    printf("Stage " #num ": ");\
    scanf("%lu", &converter.uint);\
    x = converter.dbl;\
    if(cond) {\
        puts("Stage " #num " passed!");\
    } else {\
        puts("Stage " #num " failed!");\
        return num;\
    }\
} while(0);

void print_flag() {
    FILE* flagfile = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
    if (flagfile == NULL) {
        puts("Couldn't find a flag file.");
        return;
    }
    char flag[128];
    fgets(flag, 128, flagfile);
    flag[strcspn(flag, "\n")] = '\x00';
    puts(flag);
}

union cast {
    uint64_t uint;
    double dbl;
};

int main(void) {
    union cast converter;
    double x;

    DO_STAGE(1, x == -x);
    DO_STAGE(2, x != x);
    DO_STAGE(3, x + 1 == x && x * 2 == x);
    DO_STAGE(4, x + 1 == x && x * 2 != x);
    DO_STAGE(5, (1 + x) - 1 != 1 + (x - 1));

    print_flag();

    return 0;
}

```

The challenge involved passing the 5 stages as shown above, once you did that you get the flag. The vulnerability in the source code lies in the conversion of the input from an unsigned 64 bit integer to a 64 bit double (all doubles are signed). 

Passing the first stage (x == -x) was easy, just input 0. For the second stage, I just inputted really large number (18446744073709551616). I did the same thing for stage 5, I inputted a really large number (7482937498982349829478723478238794879234789234). However stage 3 and 4 proved to be quite challenging. 

After a lot of Googling and trying to understand how doubles worked, I learnt that doubles could hold undefined and unrepresentable numbers (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN" target="_blank">NaN</a> - Not a Number). I found a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36151158/how-are-nan-and-infinity-of-a-float-or-double-stored-in-memory" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> answer which listed the 64 bit binary representations of different NaNs.

For stage 3, I converted the 64 bit binary (1111111111110000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000) for negative infinity to an integer (18442240474082181120). That worked as an input and stage 3 was passed! For stage 4, I converted the 64 bit binary (1111111111101111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111) for -Max to an integer (18442240474082181119). 

After finding the correct inputs, I connected to their shell server, inputted in the numbers and got the flag.

# stickystacks (Binary Exploitation)

![ACTF 2021 Writeup](/assets/img/ctfImages/actf2021/img3.png)

Source code :

```c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>


typedef struct Secrets {
    char secret1[50];
    char password[50];
    char birthday[50];
    char ssn[50];
    char flag[128];
} Secrets;


int vuln(){
    char name[7];
    
    Secrets boshsecrets = {
        .secret1 = "CTFs are fun!",
        .password= "password123",
        .birthday = "1/1/1970",
        .ssn = "123-456-7890",
    };
    
    
    FILE *f = fopen("flag.txt","r");
    if (!f) {
        printf("Missing flag.txt. Contact an admin if you see this on remote.");
        exit(1);
    }
    fgets(&(boshsecrets.flag), 128, f);
    
    
    puts("Name: ");
    
    fgets(name, 6, stdin);
    
    
    printf("Welcome, ");
    printf(name);
    printf("\n");
    
    return 0;
}


int main(){
    setbuf(stdout, NULL);
    setbuf(stderr, NULL);

    vuln();
    
    return 0;
}

```

The hint suggested that this challenge would involve a string format vulnerability. The vulnerability lied inside the vuln function in the statement `printf(name)`. I had to read up a lot on what string format vulnerabilities were. This <a href="https://web.ecs.syr.edu/~wedu/Teaching/cis643/LectureNotes_New/Format_String.pdf" target="_blank">resource</a>, this <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/english/28476-linux-format-string-exploitation.pdf" target="_blank">resource</a> and this <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Format_string_attack" target="_blank">resource</a> proved to be very helpful.

I realized that you could leak the contents of variables in a stack using the `%x` command (which would output a hexadecimal number leaked as data from the stack). When I inputted `%8$x` and `%9$x`, I got 73465443 and 6e756620 which when converted from hexadecimal to ASCII gave me "sFTC" and " nuf" (note the space before the n in nuf) respectively. When reversing these strings, I get "CTFs" and "fun" which is part of what is stored as the variable `secret1` in the `boshsecrets` struct. This means that you could leak further arguments by going down the stack. When I did that, I realized that I was missing large chunks of the strings.

![ACTF 2021 Writeup](/assets/img/ctfImages/actf2021/img4.png)

As shown in the image above, I was missing the "sswo" in "password123" value stored in the `password` variable in the `boshsecrets` struct. Same things were happing for all of the other 3 known variables. I realized that `%x` was only printing 4 bytes because it was formatted to print a hexadecimal which is 4 bytes (the other 4 bytes of a pointer were not outputted). I needed to find the command which printed the 8 bytes of a pointer (in 64 bit computers the pointer is 8 bytes). That command was `%p` (an external representation of a pointer to void). 

![ACTF 2021 Writeup](/assets/img/ctfImages/actf2021/img5.png)

I also realized that the flag was being leaked from the 33rd argument to the 42nd argument as show in the image above (again a lot of the flag was missing since I was using `%x`).

![ACTF 2021 Writeup](/assets/img/ctfImages/actf2021/img6.png)

After inputting the same commands but this time with `%33$p` all the way to `%42$p`, the entirety of the flag was leaked as shown in the images above (I still had to reverse the strings after converting the hexadecimal to ASCII). However, the final part of the flag (what %42$p gives) `a7d333935663161` (in hexadecimal) would return `§Ó3Vc` when converted to ASCII. I realized that the closing brackiet `}` found in the flag format, actf{flag}, had a value of 7D in ASCII. That meant that I should only convert `7d333935663161` to ASCII by removing the "a". After doing that and adding up the pieces, I got the flag.

The hint suggested that this challenge would involve using gdb (GNU Debugger). The way I solved the challenge didn't require gdb at all.
