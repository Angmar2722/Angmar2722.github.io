title: Zh3r0 2021 CTF Writeup
---
<hr/>

We competed in the <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/1285" target="_blank"> 2021 Zh3r0 CTF V2 CTF</a> event (Fri, 04 June 2021, 18:30 SGT â€” Sun, 06 June 2021, 18:30 SGT). We ranked 48th out of 509 scoring teams.

I managed to solve only 2 challenges (I need to learn so much more....) and both were under the cryptography category (first time solving a cryptography CTF challenge).

Here are the writeups :

# 1n_jection (Cryptography)

![Zh3r0 2021 Writeup](/assets/img/ctfImages/zh3r02021/img2.png)

This was the source code provided for the challenge :

```python

from secret import flag

def nk2n(nk):
    l = len(nk)
    if l==1:
        return nk[0]
    elif l==2:
        i,j = nk
        return ((i+j)*(i+j+1))//2 +j
    return nk2n([nk2n(nk[:l-l//2]), nk2n(nk[l-l//2:])])

print(nk2n(flag))
#2597749519984520018193538914972744028780767067373210633843441892910830749749277631182596420937027368405416666234869030284255514216592219508067528406889067888675964979055810441575553504341722797908073355991646423732420612775191216409926513346494355434293682149298585

```

So the encryption function was provided `nk2n()` and the flag ciphertext was also provided (the commented large integer). So we had to reverse this encryption process from the ciphertext to the flag itself.

The function encrypts text by taking in a **list** of ASCII characters. It then checks if the length of that list is 1 or 2. If it is 1, it returns the element itself (as list length is 1) and if it is 2, it would return ((i+j)*(i+j+1))//2 +j. Since the first element is i and second element is j, doing (i + j) * (i + j + 1) gives an even number which is then divided by 2 (floor division). Then the second element is added.

This function also recursively calls itself as shown in the last return statement. So it first divides the list into two parts so for example if the list had 5 elements, the first part would be the first 3 elements and the second part would be the last 2 elements (for list length of 4 it would be 2 and 2 for the splits). It then calls itself (nk2n) with each split or half and repeats the process until the base case of length equals 1 or 2 and finally the ciphertext is outputted.

Here is an example of how it works with the test input flag of "zh3r0{}" :

```python

flag = [122, 104, 51, 114, 48, 123, 125]
#z   h   3  r   0  {   }    
#122 104 51 114 48 123 125

def nk2n(nk):

    l = len(nk)
    if l==1:
        print("l == 1 : ", "returning:", nk)
        return nk[0]
    elif l==2:
        #print("l ==2:", nk)
        i,j = nk
        print("l == 2 :", nk, "returning:", ( (i+j) * (i+j+1) ) // 2 + j)
        return ( (i+j) * (i+j+1) ) // 2 + j

    #print("nk2n[:", l-l//2, "] nk2n[", l-l//2, ":]")
    print("First half : ", nk[:l-l//2], "Second half :", nk[ l-l//2:])
    return nk2n(  [ nk2n(nk [:l-l//2] ) , nk2n(nk[ l-l//2:] ) ]       )

print("The encrypted flag is : ", nk2n(flag))

```

And when you test this, you can see how the function keeps splitting the input into half into two halves until the base case of list length 1 or 2 is reached :

![Zh3r0 2021 Writeup](/assets/img/ctfImages/zh3r02021/img3.png)

So what we have to do is first split the original input into the two previous halves and for each of those halves split them into further two halves until we reach a list of ASCII printable characters (so from ints 32 to 126).

Suppose we start with the input (n) and we need to split it into the two previous halves i and j :

![Zh3r0 2021 Writeup](/assets/img/ctfImages/zh3r02021/img4.png)

I noticed than when multiplying the equation by 2, (i + j) equals the square root of 2n. So we can now find j :

![Zh3r0 2021 Writeup](/assets/img/ctfImages/zh3r02021/img5.png)

After dividing the above by 2, we get j. So with that we can get i, it is just the square root of n minus j (as the root of n is i + j). And with that we have split the input into its two previous splits or halves. With that, we could create a function which takes in an input and splits it into the two previous halves. We could repeat this process until we split our original input into a list of only ASCII printable characters (so if we had a certain element lying in the range 32 to 126, we wouldn't split it further). 

One problem that I came across is that sometimes I would get a negative value for j (which probably came because there are two solutions for j (negative and positive) and the negative one happened to be solved for). So my teammate noticed that in these cases where j was negative, the value of i was one less than the absolute value of j. So we solved for i by multiplying j by -1 (as j was negative) and then subtracting 1. With that we have i and we could then calculate j as j equals the equation below (and we know i and n) :

![Zh3r0 2021 Writeup](/assets/img/ctfImages/zh3r02021/img6.png)

To obtain j, we formed a quadratic equation in terms of j from `(i + j) (i + j + 1) + 2j = 2n` as shown above (note that we only solved for the positive solution using the quadratic formula as j has to be positive). And with that we now know how to keep splitting each input further and further until we get a list of ASCII characters which is the flag.

This was my solution script :

```python

import math
from itertools import chain

def nk2n(nk):
    l = len(nk)
    if l==1:
        return nk[0]
    elif l==2:
        i,j = nk
        return ((i+j)*(i+j+1))//2 +j
    return nk2n([nk2n(nk[:l-l//2]), nk2n(nk[l-l//2:])])

_1_50 = 1 << 50  # 2**50 == 1,125,899,906,842,624

def isqrt(x):
    if x < 0:
        raise ValueError('square root not defined for negative numbers')
    if x < _1_50:
        return int(math.sqrt(x))  # use math's sqrt() for small parameters
    n = int(x)
    if n <= 1:
        return n  # handle sqrt(0)==0, sqrt(1)==1
    r = 1 << ((n.bit_length() + 1) >> 1)
    while True:
        newr = (r + n // r) >> 1  # next estimate by Newton-Raphson
        if newr >= r:
            return r     
        r = newr

def quadraticFormulaPositive(a, b, c):
    t1 = (-1) * b
    discriminant = (pow(b, 2)) - (4) * a * c
    t4 = math.sqrt(discriminant)
    return int( (t1) + t4 ) // ( 2 * a)
 
def nextPrevious2(n):
    n2 = 2 * n
    pPlusq = isqrt(n2)
    j2 = n2 - (pPlusq)*(pPlusq+1)
    if (j2 < 0):
        i = ( (-1) * j2//2 ) - 1
        c = pow(i, 2) + i -n2
        j = quadraticFormulaPositive(1, (3 + 2*i), c)
        return [i, j]
    j = j2//2
    i = pPlusq - j
    check = ( (i + j) * (i + j + 1) ) // 2 + j
    #print(check - n)
    return [i, j]

input = 2597749519984520018193538914972744028780767067373210633843441892910830749749277631182596420937027368405416666234869030284255514216592219508067528406889067888675964979055810441575553504341722797908073355991646423732420612775191216409926513346494355434293682149298585 
masterList = nextPrevious2(input)
print("Initial 2 splits : ", masterList)

while (nk2n(masterList) == input):
    previousMasterList = masterList
    tempList = []
    allless = True
    for i in range(len(masterList)):
        #print("element i:", masterList[i])
        if masterList[i] > 126:
            tempList.append(nextPrevious2(masterList[i]))
            allless = False
        else:
            tempList.append([masterList[i],])
        #print("TL:", tempList)
    masterList = list(chain.from_iterable(tempList))
    if allless:
        break
    print("ML:", masterList)

print("Flag ASCII List Is : ", previousMasterList)


flag = ""
for i in range(len(previousMasterList)):
    flag = flag + chr(previousMasterList[i])

print(flag)

```

And after running the script (you can see how the original input is split into its halves and so on until you reach the flag - list of ASCII characters) :
