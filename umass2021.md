title: UMass 2021 CTF Writeup
---
<hr/>

Me and my team competed in the University of Massachusetts Amherst's Capture The Flag (CTF) event (Fri, 26 March 2021, 22:00 UTC â€” Sun, 28 March 2021, 22:00 UTC). This was my first 48 hour CTF as well as my first international CTF. We ranked 46th out of 660 scoring teams.

I learnt alot of new skills and came across my first Python Jail CTF challenge.

Below are the writeups for the 3 challenges that I managed to solve :
