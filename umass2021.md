title: UMass 2021 CTF Writeup
---
<hr/>

This was my first 48 hour CTF as well as my first international CTF as me and my team competed in the University of Massachusetts Amherst's capture the flag (CTF) event (Fri, 26 March 2021, 22:00 UTC â€” Sun, 28 March 2021, 22:00 UTC). My team ranked 46th out of 660 scoring teams.

I learnt alot of new skills and came across my first Python Jail CTF challenge.

Below are the writeups for the 3 challenges that I managed to solve :
