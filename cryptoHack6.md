<hr/>

The Block Ciphers section consists of 22 challenges. The challenges are subdivided into 9 different stages : AES, Block Cipher Modes, ECB, CBC, OFB, CTR, GCM, Other Modes and Other Ciphers. Below are the writeups for the ones I managed to complete for the AES and Block Cipher Modes sections :

As shown in the image above, I just had to enter the mathematical term for a one-to-one correspondence, a bijection.

**Flag :** crypto{bijection}

As shown in the image above, I just had to enter the name of the best current single-key attack against AES which is a Biclique attacl..

**Flag :** crypto{Biclique}
