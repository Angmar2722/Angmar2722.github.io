<a href="https://exploit.education/" target="_blank">Exploit Education</a> as stated in its website "provides a variety of resources that can be used to learn about vulnerability analysis, exploit development, software debugging, binary analysis, and general cyber security issues". They have challenges (like Phoenix, Nebula, Fusion, Main Sequence, Protostar) which you can access on your virtual machine by mounting the ISO.

I hope that by trying the different challenges, I can improve my binary exploitation and reverse engineering skills.
