**Note :** Since I mainly specialise in cryptography related challenges, a list of writeups for all crypto related challenges that I have solved during the duration of a CTF in 2021 can be found <a href="https://github.com/Angmar2722/Angmar2722.github.io/blob/master/CTFwriteups/CryptoWriteupsList/crypto2021.md" target="_blank">here</a>.

Due to a lack of time or due to playing another CTF which was occuring at the same time, I couldn't really spend much time at all for some CTFs. Below is the link for some solve scripts for random cryptography challenges that I solved during the duration of such CTFs :
