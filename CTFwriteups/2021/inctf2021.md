The function `gen_bob_key` generates Bob's private key d<sub>B</sub> but it has a serious vulnerability as it uses the function `gen_key` which returns the sum of 4 unknown bytes. Although there are 256<sup>4</sup> possibilities for the 4 bytes, since the sum is returned as the private key, there can only be a maximum value of 1020 (255 * 4) with in-between values being different combinations of 4 bytes. Alice's private key D<sub>a</sub> is also generated using `gen_key` hence it too will have only a maximum value of 1020. Alice's public key Q<sub>a</sub> is calculated by Q<sub>a</sub> = D<sub>a</sub> * G which is the result of adding G to itself d times as explained above. G or the generator point can be caluclated as curve parameters are given. By running two loops till 1020 in order to guess the correct private keys for both, the shared secret (SS) can be quickly calculated as SS = d<sub>B</sub> * Q<sub>a</sub>. Note that this is the x-coordinate of SS hence in the solve script, SS = d<sub>B</sub> * Q<sub>a</sub>.xy()[0] is used. From there, the shared secret can be used as the key to decrypt the AES-CBC ciphertext to get the flag.

The Sage solve script :

```python

import pickle
import os, hashlib, pickle
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad, unpad

with open("enc.pickle", "rb") as f:
    given = pickle.load(f)

print(given)

ct = given["cip"]
givenIV = given["iv"]

p = 0xFFFFFFFF00000001000000000000000000000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
a = p - 3
b = 0x5AC635D8AA3A93E7B3EBBD55769886BC651D06B0CC53B0F63BCE3C3E27D2604B

EC = EllipticCurve(GF(p), [a, b])
G = EC.gens()[0]

def decrypt(key, msg):
	key = hashlib.sha256(str(key).encode()).digest()[:16]
	cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, bytes.fromhex(givenIV))
	return cipher.decrypt(msg)

for i in range(1021):
    print(i)
    #bobPrvKeyGuess = i
    #i = 423 is answer
    for alicePubKeyGuess in range(1021):
        try:
            SS = (i * alicePubKeyGuess * G).xy()[0]
            flagGuess = decrypt(SS, bytes.fromhex(ct))
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            continue
        if(flagGuess[:6] == b"inctf{"):
            print("")
            print(flagGuess)
            exit(0)

```

The file with the ciphertext, IV and leak can be found <a href="https://github.com/Angmar2722/Angmar2722.github.io/blob/master/assets/ctfFiles/2021/inctf2021/rightNowGenerator/enc.pickle" target="_blank">here</a>. We have a `RNG` class which supposedly acts as a random number generator. Let's break it down. The key for decrypting the ciphertext (AES-CBC where IV is given) is the variable `out1`. Our objective is to recover out1 given the leak which is the values of out2.

Firstly, a RNG object is created (denoted by `obj` in the source code), a constant prime number is used as shown by the line `mod = int(gmpy2.next_prime(2**sze))`. The value of this is 18446744073709551629 and will be denoted as `P` henceforth. The object is initialized with 16 random bytes (128 random bits) using the `random` library in Python. Since no seed is specified, after ensuring that the seed_val is 128 bits, the `gen_seed` function is called. This function isn't really that important as all it returns is a list of 64 numbers by performing a series of calculations. After that, since the `next` method is called, four variables, a, b, c and d are calculated by the line `a, b, c, d = (self.seed[self.ctr^i] for i in range(4))`. After that, a serious of modular operations are performed. There is a counter which increments each time `next` is called (out1 calls it 64 times). The variable `k` equals 1 if the counter is an even number else it is 2. Focusing just on a and b :

\\(a = ( ka - b ) \ mod \ P\\)

Note that if the counter reaches 64, the values of a are returned for `out1` and `out2` and then the `wrap` function is called which performs a series of operations shown in the source code above which transforms the original list of 64 numbers. So in our case, we have the 64 leaked a values for out2 and somehow we have to get to the transformed and 'wrapped' list of 64 numbers. After that, we have to reverse the operations performed in `wrap` after which we would reach the original list of 64 values used for `out1` which is the key itself.

One thing I noticed after running the programs a few times and printing different values locally was that the first time `next` is called, a equals the first number in the list of 64 numbers and b equals the second number in that list. The second time `next` is called, a equals the second number and b equals the first number in the list. The third time it is called, a is the third number and b is the fourth and the fourth time it is called, a is the fourth number and b the third. Hence thinking of it as pairs of two `next` calls, a is always the first number when the call (starting from 0 to 63) and hence counter is even (and k = 2) and b is always the first number when the counter (and call) is odd. This means that these two variables can be related in some way as they switch their values every 2 values. 

First equation in the pair = \\( ( 2a - b ) \ mod \ P\\)

Second equation in the pair = \\( ( b - a ) \ mod \ P\\)

Remember that the values are switched for a and b in the second equation in the pair. I found that looking at each pair (counter even and counter odd and not) where l<sub>1</sub> is the first leaked value in the pair and l<sub>2</sub> the second leaked value in the pair :


If 2a - b < P i.e. 2a - b = \\( ( 2a - b ) \ mod \ P\\) and b - a < P i.e. b - a = \\( ( b - a ) \ mod \ P\\) :

2a - b = l<sub>1</sub>

b - a = l<sub>2</sub>


If 2a - b < P and b - a > P :

2a - b = l<sub>1</sub>

b - a = -(-l<sub>2</sub> + P)


If 2a - b > P and b - a < P :

2a - b = -(-l<sub>1</sub> + P)

b - a = l<sub>2</sub>


Using Sage which can solve these systems of modular equations. I tested these 3 cases, whichever case returned a non-empty list was the real value for a and b. We can now recover the previous state which would provide us with the list of 64 wrapped numbers. To reverse the operations in `wrap`, a bit of knowledge regarding modular arithmetic is required. Let's look at `wrap` :
