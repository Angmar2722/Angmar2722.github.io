I participated in <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/1434" target="_blank">Ohio State University's Buckeye CTF 2021</a> event, playing as part of Social Engineering Experts over the weekend (Sat, 23 Oct. 2021, 08:00 SGT â€” Mon, 25 Oct. 2021, 08:00 SGT). The CTF went really well for us and this is my best performance in terms of ranking in any CTF that I have gone for yet. In the end we ranked 7<sup>th</sup> out of 505 scoring teams.

I managed to sweep all the crypto challenges and even got a first blood. I also learnt about how neural networks work at a very high level while solving the 'Neurotic' reverse engineering challenge with Diamondroxxx. Overall it was a pretty fun CTF. Note that the challenges marked as 'easy' started out at 100 points whilst the other challenges started at 500 points. On a side note, the site used the <a href="https://github.com/redpwn/rctf" target="_blank">rctf</a> platform which looks minimalist and gorgeous!
