Initially, I wasn't planning on even participating in the <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/1318" target="_blank">2021 Google CTF</a> event because it had a rating weight of 99.22 on CTFtime which speaks volumes about its immensive difficulty. I was rightfully positive about the fact that even the simplest challenges would be much more difficult than normal CTFs. I was still relatively new to CTFs (it had been nearly 5 months since I started) and I knew that this was definitely an 'elite' CTF which all the top teams would participate in.

The CTF time schedule was Sat, 17 July 2021, 08:00 SGT â€” Mon, 19 July 2021, 07:59 SGT. When it started at 8 am, I just briefly looked at the challenges incase there was something that I could even remotely think of attempting and turns out there wasn't :( However, at 4 pm or after 12 hours, they released new challenges and one of them was the cryptography challenge known as "Pythia" which was a challenge about AES-GCM. I knew just a bit about how that worked and could understand what was happening in the attached server code so I thought that I could give it a shot. Instead of the usual team name 'Isengard', I instead chose 'gcmTime' for this CTF (because of the Pythia challenge). I called up Diamondroxxx and we immeditaly started working on Pythia and after solving that, we tried other challenges till the end of the CTF, working as a two man team.

As expected, even the easiest challenge (in terms of solves) would still be considered a medium difficulty challenge in some other CTFs (at least in my opinion). The challenges were of very high quality and most proved to be out of reach for us. In the end, we managed to solve 3 challenges and we ranked 80th out of 379 scoring teams.

Overall, this CTF was a fantastic learning experience and gave me a sense of what a top or elite CTF looked like, suffice to say it was very challenging.... Even for the challenges that I couldn't solve but at least attempted, I managed to learn a lot and was introduced to new concepts which I had absolutely no knowledge about previously such as the Hidden Number Problem and Huffman Coding.

Below are the writeups :

## Story

![Google CTF 021 Writeup](/assets/img/ctfImages/google2021/img3.png)

Server source code provided (this is in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Dart</a> programming language) :

```dart

#!/usr/bin/env dart

import 'dart:convert';
import 'dart:io';

// NOTE: calculate and randomize functions are private (i.e., you don't have access).
import 'package:ctf_story/private.dart' show calculate, randomize;

int main(List<String> arguments) {
  final flag = File('flag.txt').readAsStringSync();
  print('Hello! Please tell me a fairy tale!');
  var line = stdin.readLineSync(encoding: utf8);
  if (utf8.encode(line).where((i) => i < 32 || i >= 128).isNotEmpty) {
    print('There are unprintable characters in your story.');
    return 0;
  }
  final firstText = line.toLowerCase();
  var crcValues = calculate(utf8.encode(line));
  print('The CRC values of your text are $crcValues.');
  List<String> expectedValues;
  do {
    expectedValues = randomize(utf8.encode(line));
  } while (expectedValues == crcValues);
  if (expectedValues == null) {
    print('Your story is too short. Bye!');
    return 0;
  }
  print('But I am looking for a story of $expectedValues.');
  line = stdin.readLineSync(encoding: utf8);
  final secondText = line.toLowerCase();
  crcValues = calculate(utf8.encode(line));
  if (firstText != secondText) {
    print('Perhaps you would like to start from scratch? Bye!');
    return 0;
  }
  if (List.generate(
              expectedValues.length, (i) => crcValues[i] == expectedValues[i])
          .indexOf(false) <
      0) {
    print('What a lovely story! Your flag is ${flag}');
  }
  print('Bye!');
  return 0;
}

```

When we connect to the server, we are prompted to enter some ASCII printable characters. The CRC values of the input is then calculated. CRC stands for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check" target="_blank">Cyclic Redundancy Check</a> which is a kind of checksum / error detecting code. There are many variants of CRCs which encode messages with different lengths and polynomials. An exhaustive list of different CRC variants can be found <a href="https://reveng.sourceforge.io/crc-catalogue/all.htm" target="_blank">here</a>. After playing around with online CRC calculators, we realised that the three CRC values outputted by the `calculate` function corresponded to CRC-16 (also known as CRC-16 ARC), CRC-32C (also known as CRC-32/CASTAGNOLI or ISCSI) and CRC-64/XZ.

Great, so now we knew what the calculate function does. Moving on, each of the three CRC values is then converted to a different CRC value using an unknown `randomize` function. After that, these values are outputted and we are then prompted to input another set of ASCII characters. After that, the CRC values of our input is calculated and if it maches the values generated by the randomize function, we get the flag. The input had to also be at least 256 bytes as otherwise our session would end as our "story is too short". Two things stumped us. Firstly, we were supposed to input two strings which had to match as shown by the line `if (firstText != secondText)` which would exit if our first input did not match the second. Secondly, we were confused as to how to figure out what randomize did exactly.

Turns out we were being incredibly foolish as it took us a long time to realize that our input is converted to lower case, `final firstText = line.toLowerCase();` and so is our second input which means that our inputs could be the same but have different capitalizations (like aaaAAA and AAAaAA). The CRC values for our second input is calculated for that input and not the lower case string. This means that as long as we have different capitalizations for our input, we could bypass this check but the bigger question remained, now what exactly were we supposed to do?

Turns out Google (the organisers of this CTF) had <a href="https://github.com/google/crclib.dart" target="_blank">written a CRC library in Dart</a> where there was an option "To flip bits to obtain desired CRC values" which meant that by using this library, "one can call flipWithData or flipWithValue depending on whether they have access to the message, or only its calculated CRC value" which is exactly what we needed. We needed to flip the capitalizations (bits) of our original input (note that the difference between each ASCII value of a lower case and upper case character is always 32) based on the 'random' CRC values outputted by the server. Conveniently and coincidentally (maybe not?), the test CRC flipper that they provided already used the exact three variants used by the server in our challenge.

Based on that, we modified the code and made a Dart program which would calculate the desired string based on the random CRC values outputted by the server :

So what we inputted into the server was 512 capital 'A's and based on the random CRC values outputted by the server, we modified the CRC bit flipper to get the corresponding text :

We were the 13th solver for this challenge so that was pretty neat :

The entire reason we played in this CTF was to solve this challenge hence the team name "gcmTime". Lets break down the code. First a list of 3 tuples or passwords is generated. They are randomly chosen from all the lowercase alphabets a to z. For example, the passwords could be { (c, m, i), (o, f, l), (q, x, s) }. After that we are presented with four options. The first option allows us to set a key which is based on the positional index of the password list. So if we choose our key as 2, this would correspond to a key (q, x, s) in our previous example. The second option is what we have to use for getting the flag. It asks us to input a continuous string of the password (so cmioflqxs for example) and if we have successfully found that, we get the flag. Choosing the fourth option simply allows us to exit the program session.

The third option is where the most interesting stuff happens. We are prompted to send a ciphertext and nonce encoded in base 64. A relatively new kdf or password based key derivation function known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt" target="_blank">Scrypt</a> is used to generate a key from the password / key that we specified in option 1 (to set the key i.e. password).

It works the following way and is explained in detail in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkWAgeSYL_Q&t=742s" target="_blank">video</a> :

![Google CTF 021 Writeup](/assets/img/ctfImages/google2021/img7.png)

After that, an AES-GCM cipher object is generated from this key and is used to decrypt the ciphertext. If the decryption was successful (meaning that our ciphertext did correspond to the actual key/password), the server would prompt us with "Decryption successful" and otherwise it would prompt us with a failure in decryption. We have a maximum of 150 queries and each query is delayed by 10 seconds to prevent possible bruteforce attacks (by making it take too long in the server interaction since there are only 26 cubed or 17,576 password possibilities). A quick reminder into how AES-GCM (which is widely used now) works :

![Google CTF 021 Writeup](/assets/img/ctfImages/google2021/img8.png)

So we have an oracle! After some research, we found just what we needed. There has been some pretty new literature on Partitioning Oracle Attacks which was the title of <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1491.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a> published by Julia Len, Paul Grubbs and Thomas Ristenpart of Cornell University in 2020. They describe partitioning oracles as a new class of decryption error oracles which, conceptually, take a ciphertext as input and output whether the decryption key belongs to some known subset of keys. This is exactly what we needed. Further quoting the paper, "We introduce the first partitioning oracles which arise when encryption schemes are not committing with respect to their keys. We detail novel adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks that exploit partitioning oracles to efficiently recover passwords and deanonymize anonymous communications. The attacks utilize efficient key multi-collision algorithms â€” a cryptanalytic goal that we define â€” against widely used authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) schemes, including AES-GCM, XSalsa20/Poly1305, and ChaCha20/Poly1305. Briefly, a partitioning oracle arises when an adversary can: (1) efficiently craft ciphertexts that successfully decrypt under a large number of potential keys, and (2) submit such ciphertexts to a system that reveals whether decryption under a target secret key succeeds. This enables learning information about the secret key."

Sounds awesome, they have even written a Sage implementation of their attack for AEAD modes such as GCM over <a href="https://github.com/julialen/key_multicollision" target="_blank">here</a> which is exactly what we needed. Again quoting the research paper : "The main cryptanalytic step for our attacks is constructing (what we call) key multi-collisions, in which a single AEAD ciphertext can be built such that decryption succeeds under some number k of keys. We formalize this cryptanalytic goal and give an algorithm for computing key multi-collisions for AES-GCM. It builds key multi-collision ciphertexts of length O(k) in O(k^2) time using polynomial interpolation from off-the-shelf libraries, making them reasonably scalable even to large k. Given access to an oracle that reveals whether decryption succeeds, our key multi-collisions for AES-GCM enable a partitioning oracle attack that recovers the secret key in roughly m+logk queries in situations where possible keys fall in a set of size d = mÂ·k. This will not work to recover much information about, e.g., random 128-bit keys where d = 2^128, but we show that it suffices to be damaging in settings where keys are derived from user-selected passwords or where key anonymity is important."

We first precomputed a partion list of 1000 keys locally (written in Sage) in order to speed up the actual process when connecting with the server. The script for that can be found <a href="https://github.com/Angmar2722/Angmar2722.github.io/blob/master/assets/ctfFiles/google2021/Pythia/cipherListgenerator.sage" target="_blank">here</a>. We then deployed this <a href="https://github.com/Angmar2722/Angmar2722.github.io/blob/master/assets/ctfFiles/google2021/Pythia/cipherList.txt" target="_blank">cipherList</a> in our actual Sage solve script :

We were the <a href="https://github.com/Angmar2722/Angmar2722.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/ctfImages/google2021/img10.png" target="_blank">9th solver</a> for this challenge so that was pretty cool, especially the fact that our team name was in the company of some legendary CTF teams like PPP, Dice Gang and pasten). We also did our team name 'gcmTime' justice.
