During the weekend, I participated in the <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/1315" target="_blank">New York University Tandon School of Engineering's CSAW Quals 2021 CTF</a> event (Sat, 11 Sept. 2021, 04:00 SGT — Mon, 13 Sept. 2021, 04:00 SGT), playing as part of Social Engineering Experts. I was really, really, really looking forward to this CTF as it is a pretty famous one and has a rich history behind it. The CTF started at 4 am on Saturday and after nearly 2 days of grinding, we managed to rank 23<sup>rd</sup> out of 1216 scoring teams :

Me and Diamondroxxx once again worked together on some of the challenges and in the end, we managed to sweep the crypto challenges :

At one point in the CTF (nearly a day in), we even managed to <a href="https://github.com/Angmar2722/Angmar2722.github.io/blob/master/assets/img/ctfImages/2021/csaw2021/img4.png" target="_blank">breach the top 10</a> but although it didn't last long, this was easily my most successful CTF yet. I really enjoyed the cryptography challenges and learnt quite a lot including some aspects of the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank">Rust programming language</a>. I managed to solve 9 challenges, some of them in close collaboration with Diamondroxxx.

Let's break down the server code. We have a composite modulus <i>N</i> which is generated using two primes <i>p</i> and <i>q</i>. It is also mentioned that <i>p ≡ q ≡ 3 mod 4</i> which means that <i>N</i> is a Blum integer. In mathematics, a natural number <i>n</i> is a Blum integer if <i>n = p×q</i> is a semiprime for which <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> are distinct prime numbers congruent to 3 mod 4. When we connect to the server, a random secret integer <i>d</i> is generated using `RandGen`. The secret integer <i>d</i> lies between the 0 and the order of <i>N</i>. An order of a cyclic group modulo <i>N</i> is the smallest number <i>k</i> such that <i>G<sup>k</sup> ≡ 1 mod N</i>. A constant generator <i>G</i> is used whose value is fixed as 2. Note that we will refer to <i>G</i> as a generator despite the fact that no <i>G</i> can generate all the elements in the cyclic group of units (integers whose modular multiplicative inverses exist with respect to <i>N</i>) modulo <i>N</i> where <i>N</i> is the product of two odd primes. . The public key is calculated such that <i>pubKey ≡ G<sup>d</sup> mod N</i>.

After the generation of the public
