I participated in <a href="" target="_blank">Perfect Blue's 2021 CTF</a> over the weekend (Sat, 09 Oct. 2021, 08:00 SGT â€” Mon, 11 Oct. 2021, 08:00 SGT) playing as part of Social Engineering Experts. Me and Diamondroxxx managed to solve half of the crypto challs, the challenges were hard to say the least. 

The level of difficulty was on par with Google CTF 2021, there were no sanity checks or survey challenges hence the number of scoring teams was greatly reduced. In the end, we ranked 32<sup>nd</sup> out of 210 scoring teams (there were 1535 registered teams).

Crypto was hard :(
