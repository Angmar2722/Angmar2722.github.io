Me and Diamondroxxx competed as the two man CTF team "Isengard" in the <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/1327" target="_blank">Redpwn 2021 CTF</a> event (Sat, 10 July 2021, 03:00 SGT — Tue, 13 July 2021, 03:00 SGT). We got up at 3 am since that's when it started and the CTF lasted for 3 days. We ranked 41st out of 1418 scoring teams and once again, this was our best CTF performance yet.
