Originally I wasn't planning to play any CTF during this weekend but Diamondroxxx asked me if I could as he and the other members of Social Engineering Experts were participating in <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/1417" target="_blank">Yauza CTF 2021</a>, a Soviet themed CTF. Me and Diamondroxxx solved all the crypto challenges in Yauza in a few hours so we decided to check if there was some CTF going on. 

Turns out the top CTF team from Tunisia Fword was hosting their own CTF <a href="https://ctftime.org/event/1405" target="_blank">Fword CTF 2021</a> and it had some crypto challenges so we decided to play as Isengard as it was only the both of us for that. Sadly we joined late for both CTFs. Fword was only 1 and a half days long and was from Sat, 28 Aug. 2021, 01:00 SGT â€” Sun, 29 Aug. 2021, 13:00 SGT and we only joined at around 4pm on Saturday. We tried to solve as many crypto challenges as we could until 3 am (we were stuck on the Ed25519 curve challenge). We ranked 55<sup>th</sup> out of 428 scoring teams, focusing only on the crypto challenges.
