I started my cybersecurity journey in March 2021 in high school when I participated in my first CTF - Whitehacks by Singapore Management University (SMU). Since then, I have gone for many more and have written writeups for each CTF which explains how I solved some challenges. My older writeups and writeups which I am not particularly proud of can be found <a href="https://github.com/Angmar2722/Angmar2722.github.io/blob/master/CTFwriteups/worseWriteups.md" target="_blank">here</a>. Below are the writeups :
