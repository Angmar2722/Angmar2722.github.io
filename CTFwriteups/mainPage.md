I started my cybersecurity journey in March 2021 in high school when I participated in my first CTF - Whitehacks by Singapore Management University (SMU). Since then, I have gone for many more and have written writeups for each CTF which explains how I solved some challenges. I usually play as part of the team <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/151372" target="_blank">Social Engineering Experts</a> and sometimes as part of <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/78268" target="_blank">Isengard</a> when I am just playing with close friends.

Below are the writeups (only displayed for the current year) :

<br/>

| CTF Writeup | Weight | Team | Rank | Points | 
| ------------- |  --- | --- | ------ | -----: |

<!-- Due to a lack of time or due to playing another CTF which was occuring at the same time, I couldn't really spend much time at all for some CTFs. Below is the link for some solve scripts for random cryptography challenges that I solved during the duration of such CTFs :
